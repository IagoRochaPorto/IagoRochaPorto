Hello, I'm Iago Rocha Porto and I'm a Software Developer

- I'm Software Architecture enthusiast (I'm currently learning Domain Driven Design and SOLID principles)
- I'm very familiar with TypeScript, NodeJS, Ionic and ReactJS
- I'm currently working with an Angular Ionic and React Ionic Stack
- But I ain't a JavaScript Developer, I'm a developer !!! ðŸ¤£, so with the programming principles, i'll learn every language that is required for my career
- As you may have noticed, I write a lot of "I ams" ðŸ˜…, but my english is in constant improvement
